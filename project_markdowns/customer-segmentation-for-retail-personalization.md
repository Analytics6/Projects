# Customer Segmentation for Retail Personalization

Brief: Segment customers for targeted personalization and marketing activation.

- Objectives:
  - Create actionable segments based on behavior and value.
- Scope:
  - RFM, behavioral, lifecycle segmentation, lookalike audiences.
- Key Components:
  - Segmentation engine, feature pipelines, export connectors.
- Technologies:
  - Databricks, ML libraries, campaign connectors.
- Deliverables:
  - Segment definitions, export pipelines, sample campaigns.

# Expanded Source Schemas, ER Diagrams, Facts & Dimensions

This standardized expansion provides five logical sources for the project and a canonical set of artifacts to be appended to project markdown files when a detailed schema is required.

NOTE: The artifacts below are design artifacts created for documentation and implementation planning. They are original work and may be used for internal design and implementation purposes.

Project-specific prefix: `customer_segmentation_for_retail_personalization` (derived from filename: `customer-segmentation-for-retail-personalization.md`).

Common guidance:
- Always keep an immutable staging/raw zone for auditable ingestion.
- Use `audit_*` tables and checksums for reconciliation between source and target facts.
- Implement SCD patterns for dimensions where history is required.
- Register datasets in a data catalog and apply RBAC and PII protections as required.
